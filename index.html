          <h3> Lecturer, United International University, Bangladesh</h3>

        </div>
        <p>I have recently graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and am currently employed as a Lecturer in the department of CSE in United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am highly motivated in research related to Human Computer Interaction, Crowdsourcing and Social computing, Ubiquitous Computing, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning. My long-term goal is to combine teaching with performing noble  research on these topics. I have recently graduated from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and am currently employed as a Lecturer in the department of CSE at United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am highly motivated in research related to Human-Computer Interaction, Crowdsourcing and Social Computing, Ubiquitous Computing, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning. My long-term goal is to combine teaching with performing noble research on these topics. My undergraduate thesis, supervised by Dr Shamusozzoha Bayzid, was “Fast and Accurate Species Tree Estimation using Consensus Methods”. It mainly involves developing a novel consensus method to summarise a set of gene trees into a species tree, which will help to evaluate the evolution path. I participated in a machine learning competition, “Ada Lovelace Datathon by BDOC”, and became the first runner-up. In the consecutive year, I again won the second runner-up prize in the same competition, which was held internationally. From 2021, I shifted my research interest from bioinformatics to Human-Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing. From 2021, I have been working on a voluntarily project on ubiquitous computing named “Group meetup prediction using spatiotemporal data”. Recently, I have started working on “Detecting mental stress in menstrual cycle among women”. My interest lies in working with Human-Computer Interaction in the long run.
          Moreover, I was the president of the IEEE Computer Society BUET Student Branch Chapter. I tried to create more opportunities for my community through this organisation. I have successfully organised Bangladesh’s first inter-university security competition, “Capture The Flag”. I have excelled in leadership and communication skill. My extra-curricular activity records are pretty decent, and I have won many awards in math, biology, science, etc. I also have a great passion for cooking and trying new foods. Besides, my interests involve travelling, dancing, and painting.

  <h3> Group meetup POI prediction by clustering.</h3><br/>
<h4> Supervised by:<a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=tanzimahashem">Dr. Tanzima Hashem</a>  (Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
<h4> Status: Manuscript in progress</h4>
  <p>This study attempts to address the problem of predicting the group meetup POI(point of interest) of a person at
    a given time where the group members are socially connected to each other. The work will help ad agencies to provide more personalized ads.Also,Crime investigation
    agencies will be able to predict criminal activities by utilizing the prediction.</p>

  <h3>Correlation Between Stress and Menstrual Cycle</h3><br/>
  <h4> Supervised by:<a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=tanzimahashem">Dr. Tanzima Hashem</a>  (Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
  <h4> Status: Project in progress</h4>

  <p>We are formulating problem trying to find the correlation between stress and it's impact on menstrual cycle</p>

  <h3>Fast and Accurate Species Tree Estimation using Consensus Methods</h3><br/>
<h4> Supervised by:<a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=bayzid">Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid</a> (Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
<h4> Supervised by: <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/rezwana">Dr. Rezwana Reaz</a> (Assistant Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
<h4> Status: Manuscript in progress</h4>


  <p>A species tree is a branching diagram or a tree showing the evolutionary relationships among various
    biological species. This study developed a two third consensus method which promise to keep the false
    positive rate zero in species tree estimation.</p>


<br/>
  <h3> Breast Ultrasound Image Segmentation</h3><br/>
<h4> Supervised by:<a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=mrahman"> Dr. Mohammad Saifur Rahman</a></h4>
<h4> Status: Project in progress</h4>


  <p>This study attempts to segment accurate breast ultrasound image  using MultiResUNet</p>

  <h3>Phylogenetic Tree Generation and Verification using Novel Algorithm</h3><br/>
<h4> Supervised by:<a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=bayzid">Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid</a> (Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
<h4> Status: Project in progress</h4>


  <p>The efficacy of a novel algorithm which used to generate phylogenetic tree is tested</p>

    <h3> <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/bulletin-board/news/young-bangladeshi-women-compete-conquer-the-data-world-2066605">Ada Lovelace Datathon by BDOC</a></h3><br/>
  <h4>First Runner Up</h4>
    <p>This datathon was held among students from 21 districts and 27 Technical Universities in Bangladesh. I, along with my team, developed a machine learning model to find the impact of Covid-19 in depression. The dataset was provided on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>.Our AUC score was good enough to predict the impact of Covid-19 on depression. </p>
    <br/>
    <h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce81v5Jvifc/">HerWILL Datathon 2022</a></h3><br/>
  <h4> Second Runner Up</h4>
    <p>The datathon was organized internationally. Teams from different country competed with my team. I, along with my team, developed a machine learning model to predict taxi count in a given day to help analyzing traffic data.</p>

      <p>A website with online diagnostic facilities and hassle-free online appointments with doctors from different hospitals. During Corona, the infection risk was increasing, so people were afraid to go to the hospital and diagnostic centre. In this system, we tried to provide a door-to-door step diagnostic centre facility to lower the risk of sick people from Corona. There were 4 kinds of users in our system. Smooth user interface and exhchanging the data between database and software were the main challenges.</p>
