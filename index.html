          <h2>I am Adiba Shaira,</h2>
          <h3> Lecturer, United International University, Bangladesh</h3>
          <h3> Graduate, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</h3>
        </div>
        <p>I have recently graduated from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and am currently employed as a Lecturer in the department of CSE in United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am highly motivated in research related to Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Ubiquitous Computing, and Machine Learning. My long-term goal is to combine teaching with performing novel research on these topics. My undergraduate thesis, supervised by Dr Shamusozzoha Bayzid, was “Fast and Accurate Species Tree Estimation using Consensus Methods”. It mainly involves developing a novel consensus method to summarise a set of gene trees into a species tree, which will help to evaluate the evolution path. I won a machine learning competition for consecutive two years. From 2021, I shifted my research interest from bioinformatics to Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning and Ubiquitous Computing.I have been working on a voluntarily project on ubiquitous computing named “Group meetup prediction using spatiotemporal data” for two years. Recently, I have started working on “Detecting mental stress in menstrual cycle among women”. My interest lies in working with Human-Computer Interaction in the long run.
          Moreover, I was the president of the IEEE Computer Society BUET Student Branch Chapter. I tried to create more opportunities for my community through this organisation. I have successfully organised Bangladesh’s first inter-university security competition, “Capture The Flag”. I have excelled in leadership and communication skill. My extra-curricular activity records are pretty decent, and I have won many awards in math, biology, science, etc. Besides, my interests involve travelling, dancing, and painting.

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <br/>
  <h3>Correlation Between Stress and Menstrual Cycle</h3><br/>
  <h4> Supervised by- <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=tanzimahashem">Dr. Tanzima Hashem</a>  (Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
  <h4> Status- Project in progress</h4>

  <p> This project aims to predict the energy level at different menstrual cycle stages. The correlation between stress and the menstrual cycle is one of the essential features in predicting energy levels. We are conducting a survey on female computer science students using a semi-constructed interview and a smartwatch. The data from the surveys will be used for empirical study and feature for the machine learning model.</p>
  <h3> Group meetup POI prediction by clustering.</h3><br/>
<h4> Supervised by: <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=tanzimahashem">Dr. Tanzima Hashem</a>  (Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
<h4> Status: Manuscript in progress</h4>
  <p>This study attempts to address the problem of predicting the group meetup POI(point of interest) of a person at
    a given time where the group members are socially connected to each other. Though predicting
    a meetup event location is inherently complex, in this study, we show that
    users' check-in and friendship data can reveal future meetup event locations
    quite confidently. The work will help ad agencies to provide more personalized ads.Also,Crime investigation
    agencies will be able to predict criminal activities by utilizing the prediction.</p>

  <h3>Fast and Accurate Species Tree Estimation using Consensus Methods</h3><br/>
<h4> Supervised by- <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=bayzid">Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid</a> (Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
<h4> Supervised by- <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty_list/detail/rezwana">Dr. Rezwana Reaz</a> (Assistant Professor, CSE, BUET)</h4>
<h4> <a href ="files/Thesis,pdf
">Status- Manuscript in progress</a> </h4>

  <p>A species tree is a branching diagram or a tree showing the evolutionary relationships among various
    biological species. In this study,we propose a 2/3 rd
    Majority Method, a highly accurate method for species tree estimation
    from gene trees, by extending upon the Majority method. 2/3 rd Majority Method was tried out
    on a collection of simulated datasets. We compared 2/3 rd Majority Method not only with Strict 
    Consensus Method, which is the best alternate method for estimating species trees with zero False
    Positive rate (FP) but also with many other consensus methods.</p>


<br/>
  <h3> Breast Ultrasound Image Segmentation</h3><br/>
<h4> Supervised by- <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/facdetail.php?id=mrahman"> Dr. Mohammad Saifur Rahman</a></h4>
<h4> Status- Project in progress</h4>


  <p>This study attempts to segment accurate breast ultrasound image  using MultiResUNet. An accurate segmented image can help to locate a tumor and predict if it's benign or malignant.</p>

      <img src="images/project/healthway.jpg" alt="Healthway">
      <p>A website with online diagnostic facilities and hassle-free online appointments with doctors from different hospitals. During COVID-19, the infection risk was increasing, so people were afraid to go to the hospital and diagnostic centre. In this system, we tried to provide a door-to-door step diagnostic centre facility to lower the risk of sick people from Corona. There were 4 kinds of users in our system. Smooth user interface and exhchanging the data between database and software were the main challenges. This website was developed mainly for the senior citizens of our country. A detailed use case study was conducted for the ux design of this project which had a significant impact in the front-end design.</p>
